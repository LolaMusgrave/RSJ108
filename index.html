Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Stay calm and be respectful.</h3>
              <p>Look at the disagreement as a discussion to exchange points of view, rather than an argument to win. Resist the urge to raise your voice. As soon as things become heated and emotional, people become more entrenched in their corners and be less likely to agree on anything. And ust because somebody doesn’t agree with you doesn’t mean that they are inferior to you, or that they don’t deserve to be treated fairly. If you find yourself struggling to respect their point of view, consider how they may have arrived at this opinion.</p> 
            </div>
          </li>

           <!-- A new step -->
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Acknowledge you value the person, just disagree on ideas.</h3>
              <p>In situations where you still need to interact with a person following a disagreement (family gatherings, work discussions), you may find it helpful to maintain a civil relationship by pointing out that your disagreement is not person-based but issue-based. Try to articulate this during your discussion. It will help both of you refrain from getting emotional.</p> 
            </div>
          </li>

           <!-- A new step -->
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Use facts instead of emotion.</h3>
              <p>An emotional argument is a weak argument. “I don’t like him because he’s mean,” is based on a feeling and not a fact. “I don’t like him because he bullied me on three separate occasions” is concrete and helps you further your argument.
               Make sure your facts are well-sourced. Not all websites created equal. When pulling facts off the internet, make sure they come from credible sources. One method is to see if you can find the same information from three separate sources.</p> 
            </div>
          </li>

           <!-- A new step -->
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Try not to take it personally.</h3>
              <p>In many cases, an argument is not about who you are as a person, it is about an opinion or belief. Try to distance yourself (and the other person) from what you think and feel about an issue. It’s only one aspect of who you are, it is not your whole self.
Disagreements will not necessarily damage your relationship with the other person, especially if you debate respectfully and don’t let it get emotional.
Of course, things are different if someone is arguing with you about who you are — your sexuality or your religion, for example. This is a personal attack and likely not something you want to engage in. You could say, “I’m not defending my faith to you, it’s very personal and not something I am arguing about.”</p> 
            </div>
          </li>

           <!-- A new step -->
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Ensure you are speaking only for yourself</h3>
              <p>When you argue your opinion, make sure you are using “I” language, not “we” language. Even if you know others in your community agree with you, the use of “we” may feel that your opponent feels ganged up upon.
For example, you may be active in the LGBTQ community, and you are discussing transgender youth with someone. While “We believe that trans youth are marginalized and need extra support,” may be a true statement, it might sound better to say, “I know that the trans community is working hard to reach trans youth, because they need so much support.” When you have familiarity with a community, it is better to draw on them for expertise rather than a silent “we” army to back you up.</p> 
            </div>
          </li>

           <!-- A new step -->
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Believe in yourself.</h3>
              <p>Believe in the integrity of your opinion. Don’t back down just because someone disagrees with you. While it can sometimes be extremely difficult to speak up for what you believe in, don’t be afraid to share your truth. Take a deep breath and be brave.
Don’t bottle up your feelings for the sake of politeness. You may be the type of person who doesn’t want to rock the boat or stir the pot, but it is good to express your disagreement from time to time. Otherwise, it’s likely that all that frustration will come out all at once in a big blow-up.
Acknowledge it is difficult for you to speak up, and people might give you more space to express yourself. You could say, “I usually don’t contribute to discussions like this because it’s hard for me to express myself sometimes, but I wanted to say….”
</p> 
            </div>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Agree to disagree.</h3>
              <p>If you seem to be going in circles (or nowhere), you two might want to let it lie. Let it go with a smile and change the subject.</p>

If you are uncomfortable with the language the other person is using (for example, using too much profanity, or using racist/bigoted language), you could say, “Look, I’m happy to debate this topic with you, but you need to stop with the swearing.”
If the argument escalates to a place that is too uncomfortable for you, you could put your hand up and say, “Okay, I think we need to end this conversation. I’m going to walk away now before things get worse,” and get some space between you and the other person.
